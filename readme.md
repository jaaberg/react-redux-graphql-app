## Universal React, Redux, GraphQL boilerplate

Stack with Node, React, GraphQL, Webpack, Redux, Hot module reloading.

Now, from the project directory install the local dependencies: `$ npm install`

To build files and run server:  `$ npm start`

This will run a server on both localhost:3000 and localhost:3001. Use localhost:3001 for hot module replacement. To trigger the dev-tools diff-monitor: `ctrl+h`.
